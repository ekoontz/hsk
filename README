    (shell "ls file:///tmp")
    (shell "mkdir hdfs://localhost:9000/foo")

### Mapreduce integration

    lein repl
    (load "wordcount")
    (ns hsk.wordcount)
    (shell "rmr file:///tmp/wordcount-out")
    (shell "mkdir file:///tmp/wordcount-out")
    (tool-run (Tool.) "file:///tmp/wordcount-in" "file:///tmp/wordcount-out")
